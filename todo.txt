- fix later migrations around showing profiles of users who have created or been assigned to tickets

- when creating an account, the user shouldnt be able to immediately login, this is different than the dev?

- create organization table
- create organization user table

- email invitation (admin can select an organization or internal and invite a user via email)

- dont let admin user remove admin status from self or other admin users
- tests for new components, also remember to create new tests anytime we make a new component or update an existing one


x sorted attributes on status and priority dropdowns
x sortable on all tickets table columns

- remove timestamp from due date column either just on creation or out of database completely
x ticket assignment at creation
- ticket table shows creator name and assignee name (or none or name+x if there are multiple)
- ticket select page needs general overhaul, but some kind of back button (close or otherwise)
- edits to tickets update ticket_history
- add a sidebar to the selected ticket page that shows the comment history, and other history
- suggested ai actions on tickets (respond with x, do y, etc) can use the knowledge base later on
- assignment types, primary, secondary, watcher

- seed tickets and assignees and history (probably create them in UI then back them up)
- SEED KNOWLEDGE BASE (what kind of company are we? maybe a clown supply company)
