sortable on all tickets table columns

ticket assignment at creation
ticket table shows creator name and assignee name (or none or name+x if there are multiple)
ticket select page needs general overhaul, but some kind of back button (close or otherwise)
edits to tickets update ticket_history
add a sidebar to the selected ticket page that shows the comment history, and other history

seed tickets and assignees and history (probably create them in UI then back them up)
SEED KNOWLEDGE BASE (what kind of company are we? maybe a clown supply company)
