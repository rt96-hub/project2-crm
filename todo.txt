x fix later migrations around showing profiles of users who have created or been assigned to tickets

- when creating an account, the user shouldnt be able to immediately login, this is different than the dev?

- create organization table
- create organization user table

- email invitation (admin can select an organization or internal and invite a user via email)

- dont let admin user remove admin status from self or other admin users
- tests for new components, also remember to create new tests anytime we make a new component or update an existing one


x sorted attributes on status and priority dropdowns
x sortable on all tickets table columns

- remove timestamp from due date column either just on creation or out of database completely
x ticket assignment at creation
x ticket table shows creator name and assignee name (or none or name+x if there are multiple)
x ticket select page needs general overhaul, but some kind of back button (close or otherwise)
x restructure layout of ticket select page
x edits to tickets update ticket_history
x add a sidebar to the selected ticket page that shows the comment history, and other history
x format ticket select page, fill height instead of spilling out
x in ticket activity and conversation sidebar, make the scroll bar start at the bottom, make the enter button auto send the message
- add attachments to ticket activity
- suggested ai actions on tickets (respond with x, do y, etc) can use the knowledge base later on
- assignment types, primary, secondary, watcher


- media table
- converstaions and activities both have media array type? or a second table that has media_id, conversation_id, activity_id (one has to be null)

- ticket_conversations table
- all messages between users and clients
- add attachments to conversations
- mentions in activity log
- notifications in general (on sidebar?)
- custom attributes on tickets, created in admin panel

- admin panel
    - create statuses, types, attributes
    - create organizations
    - invite users (to organizations or internal)
    - deactivate or make admin users

- real time updates all over, tickets, activity, conversations, notifications!!!
x notification icon on sidebar
- notifications page


- seed tickets and assignees and history (probably create them in UI then back them up)
- SEED KNOWLEDGE BASE (what kind of company are we? maybe a clown supply company)

- ai buttons on the activity and conversation sidebars
- eventually the ai buttons will suggest a relevant message or action to take on a ticket
- ai can reference existing messages, and internal and external knowledge base
- after that we wont need the ai button at all

- add db push to github actions
- npm run build and test before deploy??? maybe taken care of on amplify?
