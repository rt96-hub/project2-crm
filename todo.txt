x fix later migrations around showing profiles of users who have created or been assigned to tickets
x when creating an account, the user shouldnt be able to immediately login, this is different than the dev?

x sorted attributes on status and priority dropdowns
x sortable on all tickets table columns

x ticket assignment at creation
x ticket table shows creator name and assignee name (or none or name+x if there are multiple)
x ticket select page needs general overhaul, but some kind of back button (close or otherwise)
x restructure layout of ticket select page
x edits to tickets update ticket_history
x add a sidebar to the selected ticket page that shows the comment history, and other history
x format ticket select page, fill height instead of spilling out
x in ticket activity and conversation sidebar, make the scroll bar start at the bottom, make the enter button auto send the message
x ticket assignment to organization at creation
x filter ticket table to only active organizations

x create organization and organization_user tables, add is_customer bool to profile table
x is_customer bool defaults to false, and existing records set to false
x organization columns: name, description, customer_since, customer_type_id, customer_status_id, total_contract, default_priority_id, is_active
x organization_user columns: organization_id, profile_id
x organization_type table: id, name
    x seed in migrations - (individual, small business, large business, etc)
x organization_status table: id, name
    x seed in migrations - (in pipeline, under contract, cancelled, etc)

x when a ticket is created (maybe not from UI)
    x tickets require organization to be created
    - priority is set to the default for the organization
    x non is_active statuses, priorities, etc should not be selectable
    x make organization_id be assigned to tickets

x admin panel
    x create ticket_statuses, priorities, organization_types, organization_statuses
    - create attributes (later)
    x organization management page
        x table that shows all organizations
        x create organizations
        x select organization from table to view details and edit them
        - filter or sort organizations in table
    x users panel button
        - invite users (to organizations or internal)
        x deactivate or make admin users
        x edit user details
        x edit customer organization
        - cant disable admin on self
        - cant enable admin on customers
        - filter or sort users in table

x team page (show all employees) visible to admins
    x show a table of all non customers
    x show open tickets, other stats
    - how to see other users besides just admin and yourself?
    - can select a user to view their profile page

ROBERT !!! FIRST THING TO DO FOR SOME REASON WE CANT SEE THE TICKETS OR USERS IN THE TABLE HERE
- organization page (non customers can view, admins can edit)
    x table of all visible organizations if not a customer
        x as a non customer, you can select any of the organization pages to view
        x if a customer, navigate directly to the organization select page
    x show all users in the organization
        - click a customer user to view their profile page
    x show all tickets in the organization
        x click a ticket to view its details
    x show all details about the organization
        x name, description, customer_since, total_contract, default_priority, status, type
    x admins have ability to edit details (already in admin panel)

x DO THIS FIRST THING TOMORROW TICKET PAGE BACK ARROW????
x clicking bold button in the knowledge bacse creation page causes it to be created

x knowledge base
    x main page
        x search bar
        x categories
        x articles (public vs private)
        x create new article (non customer)
        x edit article (non customer)
    x admin panel
        x create new category (admin)
        x mark active or inactive
            x actually going to do this in the regular knowledge base page, admins will have active inactive column, and can click a button in the article itself
        x mark as public or private
    x article page
        x rich text reader
        x edit if employees
        x return to knowledge base
    x article edit page/create page
        x rich text editor
        x set category
        x set public or private


- profiles page (other users can view details)
    - all tickets, etc

- dont let admin user remove admin status from self or other admin users
- tests for new components, also remember to create new tests anytime we make a new component or update an existing one
- remove timestamp from due date column either just on creation or out of database completely
- add attachments to ticket activity
- suggested ai actions on tickets (respond with x, do y, etc) can use the knowledge base later on
- assignment types, primary, secondary, watcher
- media table
- converstaions and activities both have media array type? or a second table that has media_id, conversation_id, activity_id (one has to be null)



x customer view help chat button
    - maybe a panel that shows all their help chat conversations
    - well they can see them in their tickets

x ticket_conversations table
    - when customer sends a help chat message, it creates a ticket, and adds the message to the conversation
    - when a ticket is created, it is assigned to the employee with the least open tickets
    - all messages between users and clients
    - add attachments to conversations
- mentions in activity log
- notifications in general (on sidebar?)
- custom attributes on tickets, created in admin panel


- login as a customer
    x build their sidebar
        x dashboard
        x organization
            - they can see all the members of their organization (right now the rls is not showing the other members)
            - automatically brings them to their own organization detail page
            - maybe dont show some of the details? priorities, statuses, etc, just tickets?
        x tickets
            - table of tickets for the organization (need to fix the rls)
            x they can create a new ticket, they do the assignment manually for org and assignee
                - need to figure this out, how to pass in the org, and have the app determine the assignee
            x they can see the ticket conversation history, send messages to it
        x knowledge base
        x help chat bubble
            - help chat, need to flesh this out on both ends
            - eventually the ai will respond to messages
            - tbd
    - lock down data available to is_customer profiles
        - can only select their own organization
        - can only see their organization tickets
        - can create/edit their ticket conversations
        - can view profiles of other users in their org (is_active = true)
        - can view profiles of employees (is_active = true)
        - can view knowledge base articles (is_active = true)




- email invitation (admin can select an organization or internal and invite a user via email)
    - how to test?
    - additionally generate an invite code if they go directly to the signup page
    - invite code is somehow parsed to tell the server what user is being invited
    - prefill the names, job title, and phone number in invite form (not required though)
    - basically seems like the same process as the signup page, but the admin kicks off the process instead of a signup
    - password reset???
    





- update rls for all the above (may need to strategize this with o1)
    - replace the get_all_active_profiles function with something related to non customer profiles

- employee can see all other users, but only select
- admin can edit all users
- customer can see all profiles, but only select (and can't see a page that actually lists them, just see names when they are interacting)


- default seed for organizations and organization_users (two orgs, one user in each)
- seed data in demo site

- real time updates all over, tickets, activity, conversations, notifications!!!
x notification icon on sidebar
- notifications page
- clean up filters on tickets page

- seed tickets and assignees and history (probably create them in UI then back them up)
- SEED KNOWLEDGE BASE (what kind of company are we? maybe a clown supply company)

- ai buttons on the activity and conversation sidebars
- eventually the ai buttons will suggest a relevant message or action to take on a ticket
- ai can reference existing messages, and internal and external knowledge base
- after that we wont need the ai button at all

- add db push to github actions
- npm run build and test before deploy??? maybe taken care of on amplify?
